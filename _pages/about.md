My name is Wenbo Huang, an undergraduate from University of illinois Urbana-Champaign.


Research Interest
======
My academic interest lies in machine learning for data-limited science, large language models, and knowledge graph reasoning.

## Experience

- **Research Assistant, National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)**  
  *Champaign, IL · Dec 2023 – present*  
  I assist research on environmental science ML projects, including water quality monitoring and crop yield prediction. My work involves building machine learning models from satellite and in-situ data, improving performance and robustness, and visualizing results as geospatial maps using Python and QGIS.

- **Algorithm Development Intern, Infinigence AI**  
  *Shanghai, China · Jun 2025 – Aug 2025*  
  I worked on large-scale text data curation and LLM training. I cleaned and filtered text datasets, and fine-tuned open-source models (such as Llama 2/3) using an SFT + RL pipeline to improve accuracy and alignment.

## Publication

- **Wenbo Huang, Lihui Liu. “RKBQA: A Revise-once Correction for Generate-then-Retrieve KBQA.”**  
  Short paper accepted at **IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2025)**.  
  We propose a generate-then-retrieve KBQA framework that first produces structured query code and then applies unsupervised retrieval for entity and relation grounding, using a reflective LLM-based semantic parser to minimally revise logic forms and consistently improve over baselines on WebQSP and CWQ.

## Selected Projects

- **Weakly Supervised Cropland Mapping from Sentinel Time Series (Europe, 100m)**  
  Framed pixel-level cropland detection as a weakly supervised task using NUTS-level regional labels. I built a 1D CNN over Sentinel time-series signatures to classify cropland vs. non-cropland at 100 m resolution across Europe and visualized predictions as geospatial maps.

- **Satellite-Derived Secchi-Depth Trend Mapping Around Denmark**  
  Extracted multi-source MODIS data with cloud masking from Google Earth Engine and trained a multi-layer perceptron to predict in-situ Secchi depth. I generated 22-year (2000–2022) gridded Secchi-depth maps and performed trend analysis to identify statistically significant water clarity changes.

- **Image Reconstruction Using Deep Learning**  
  Implemented low- and high-resolution image reconstruction using MLPs trained with the Adam optimizer, leveraging Fourier feature mappings to improve visual quality.

## Teaching & Awards

- **Course Assistant, ECE 374: Introduction to Algorithms (UIUC)**  
  *Jan 2025 – May 2025*  
  Graded assignments, proctored exams, and mentored students on graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and reductions.

- **American Mathematics Competition (AMC 12), 2022**  
  Scored **104/150**, above the top 5% cutoff, and qualified for the **AIME**.
